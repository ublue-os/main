A common main image for all other uBlue images, with minimal (but important) adjustments to Fedora. <3

Deprecation Notice: Universal Blue is trimming support for intermediate images (such as those built in main) which are not used in our project's final images (Aurora, Bazzite, Bluefin).

As of September 2025, this repo will only build base, kinioite, and silverblue images.

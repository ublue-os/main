# A script to install an RPM from the latest Github release for a project.
#
# ORG_PROJ is the pair of URL components for organization/projectName in Github URL
# example: https://github.com/wez/wezterm/releases
#   ORG_PROJ would be "wez/wezterm"
#
# ARCH_FILTER is used to select the specific RPM. Typically this can just be the arch
#   such as 'x86_64' but sometimes a specific filter is required when multiple match.
# example: wezterm builds RPMs for different distros so we must be more specific.
#   ARCH_FILTER of "fedora37.x86_64" gets the x86_64 RPM build for fedora37

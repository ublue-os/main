## Thank you for contributing to the Universal Blue project!
### Guidelines
In this project we follow [Semantic PRs][1] and [Conventional Commits][2] to describe features and fixes we made. It would be nice if you did too. Not sure what this all means? Here are some [examples][3]. Did you already use this? Awesome, thanks again!
